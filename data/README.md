Yearly CO2 Emission by each Countrys Energy Con/Prod, GDP, Population and more

## About Dataset
The world is becoming more modernized by the year, and with this becoming all the more polluted.

This data was pulled from the US Energy Administration and joined together for an easier analysis. Its a collection of some big factors that play into C02 Emissions, with everything from the Production and Consumption of each type of major energy source for each country and its pollution rating each year. It also includes each countries GDP, Population, Energy intensity per capita (person), and Energy intensity per GDP (per person GDP). All the data spans all the way from the 1980's to 2020.

Feature Descriptions:
- Country - Country in question
- Energy_type - Type of energy source
- Year - Year the data was recorded
- Energy_consumption - Amount of Consumption for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)
- Energy_production - Amount of Production for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)
- GDP - Countries GDP at purchasing power parities, measured (Billion 2015$ PPP)
- Population - Population of specific Country, measured (Mperson)
- Energyintensityper_capita - Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit of capita (capita = individual person), measured (MMBtu/person)
- Energyintensityby_GDP- Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP, measred (1000 Btu/2015$ GDP PPP)
- CO2_emission - The amount of C02 emitted, measured (MMtonnes CO2)
